Modular Orthodontic Wire Generator

A comprehensive system for generating custom orthodontic wires with:
- Advanced tooth detection and bracket positioning
- Interactive 3D wire editing with height control
- Real-time G-code generation for Arduino-controlled machines
- Professional-grade visualization and export capabilities

Architecture:
- Separated drawing algorithm and 3D rendering
- Modular components for easy testing and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns

This __init__.py file is intentionally left mostly empty to avoid import issues
during test discovery and to reflect the project's evolution towards a modular,
app-driven architecture.

The main entry point for the application is now `run_app_hybrid.py`.
